# Trading Prices Widget Practice Project

This repository is provided for students looking to work on a website widget providing live prices. It’s a small project but not simple to get it working well.

It’s part of the [Trading Exchange Collaborative Learning Program](https://github.com/pecknigel/trading-exchange-collaborative-learning) from the [Prescription Free Academy of Web Development and Software Engineering](https://prescriptionfree.academy/)

Technologies Used:

- JavaScript or TypeScript
- HTML
- CSS

You’ll create a widget that could be integrated with a website, providing a table showing prices with live updates.
